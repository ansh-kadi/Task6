1.Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.
    -> password
    -> password123
    -> welcome2024
    -> Pass123
    -> Password@123
    -> Admin#2024
    -> P@ssw0rd!2025
    -> A9!kLm2@Q
    -> R#8mT!2qL9
    -> X7#qL9!vR@2mK$


2.Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.
    -> Weak: password, password123, welcome2024
    -> Medium: Pass123, Password@123, Admin#2024
    -> Strong: P@ssw0rd!2025, A9!kLm2@Q
    -> Very Strong: R#8mT!2qL9, X7#qL9!vR@2mK$


3.Test each password on password strength checker.
    -> All passwords were tested using an online password strength checker.


4.Note scores and feedback from the tool.
    -> password → Extremely weak, common dictionary word
    -> password123 → Very weak, predictable pattern
    -> welcome2024 → Weak, common word with year
    -> Pass123 → Weak, short length
    -> Password@123 → Medium, common base word
    -> Admin#2024 → Medium, role-based and predictable
    -> P@ssw0rd!2025 → Strong, mixed characters
    -> A9!kLm2@Q → Strong, random but shorter
    -> R#8mT!2qL9 → Very strong, high entropy
    -> X7#qL9!vR@2mK$ → Very strong, long and fully random


5.Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.
    -> Use 12–16+ characters minimum.
    -> Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    -> Avoid dictionary words, names, usernames, and roles (admin, user).
    -> Do not reuse passwords across multiple sites.
    -> Avoid predictable patterns (123, qwerty, abc).
    -> Do not rely on simple substitutions (a→@, o→0).
    -> Use randomly generated passwords instead of manual ones.
    -> Prefer passphrases with unrelated words if memorability is needed.
    -> Store passwords in a trusted password manager.
    -> Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
    -> Change passwords immediately after a data breach.
    -> Never share passwords or store them in plain text.


6.Write down tips learned from the evaluation.
    -> Length increases strength more than just adding symbols.
    -> Common words + numbers are still easy to guess.
    -> Adding a year or date makes passwords predictable.
    -> Capitalizing only the first letter is ineffective.
    -> Replacing letters with symbols does not add much security.
    -> Random character placement greatly improves entropy.
    -> Short random passwords are weaker than long passphrases.
    -> Reused passwords fail instantly after a data breach.
    -> Password strength meters reward entropy, not readability.
    -> Human-made passwords are usually predictable.
    -> Password managers create stronger passwords than manual creation.
    -> Strong passwords reduce the success of offline cracking attacks.


7.Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
    -> Brute Force Attack: 
        The attacker systematically tries all possible character combinations. The time required increases exponentially with password length and complexity, making long random passwords highly effective against this attack.
    -> Dictionary Attack: 
        The attacker uses lists of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords. Any password based on real words or simple patterns is quickly cracked using this method.
    -> Credential Stuffing: 
        Attackers reuse leaked credentials from past data breaches to log in on other websites. This attack succeeds mainly because users reuse the same password across multiple services.
    -> Password Spraying: 
        Instead of attacking one account repeatedly, the attacker tries one common password across many accounts to avoid lockout mechanisms. Weak but popular passwords are the main target.
    -> Rainbow Table Attack: 
        Precomputed tables of password hashes are used to reverse hashes quickly. Systems using salted and strong hashing algorithms greatly reduce the effectiveness of this attack.
    -> Phishing Attack: 
        Attackers create fake emails or websites that mimic legitimate services to trick users into entering their passwords. This attack bypasses technical defenses by exploiting user trust.
    -> Keylogging: 
        Malicious software records keystrokes to capture passwords as they are typed. Even very strong passwords can be compromised if the system itself is infected.
    -> Shoulder Surfing: 
        Passwords are observed visually in public places or through cameras. This attack relies on physical proximity rather than technical weakness.
    -> Offline Hash Cracking: 
        After stealing password hashes, attackers crack them without rate limits. Long and complex passwords significantly increase cracking time, sometimes from minutes to years.
    -> Social Engineering: 
        Attackers manipulate users through calls, messages, or impersonation to reveal passwords. This attack targets human psychology rather than system vulnerabilities.


8.Summarize how password complexity affects security.
    ->From this evaluation, it is clear that simple and commonly used passwords are very easy to break using basic attacks like dictionary attacks, password spraying, and credential stuffing. 
        As password length and randomness increase, the time and effort required to crack them also increases significantly, making brute-force and offline attacks much less effective. 
        However, even the strongest password can still be compromised through phishing, keylogging, or social engineering, which target the user rather than the system. 
        Overall, using long, unique passwords along with a password manager and multi-factor authentication provides the most practical and reliable level of security.
